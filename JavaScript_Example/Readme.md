# Functions Training Material

This project contains training material for functions in JavaScript.

## Code Examples

The `src/functions` directory contains two files:

- `incorrect.js`: Contains an incorrect implementation of the `isPalindrome` function.
- `correct.js`: Contains the corrected implementation of the `isPalindrome` function.

The `test/functions` directory contains a single file:

- `test.js`: Contains unit tests for the `isPalindrome` function.

## Running the Code

To run the unit tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```
npm test
```

This will run the tests in the `test/functions/test.js` file and output the results to the console.
